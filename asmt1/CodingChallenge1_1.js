//Coding Challenge #1.1
/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
GOOD LUCK :-)*/

//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
let markMass = 78;
let markHeight = 1.69;
let johnMass = 92;
let johnHeight = 1.76;

markMass = 85;
markHeight = 1.88;
johnMass = 55;
johnHeight = 1.76;
console.log("mark's mass: ", markMass, "kg");
//2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// const markBmi = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
let markBmi = markMass / (markHeight * markHeight);
let johnBmi = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
console.log("mark's BMI: ", markBmi);
console.log("John's BMI: ", johnBmi);

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
let markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi;
console.log(markHigherBMI);
