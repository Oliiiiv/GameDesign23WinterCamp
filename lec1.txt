programming language: instruct computer to do something
high-level: 
object oreiented: based on objects
multi-paradigm: suppoting more than one kind of programming paragigm, offers multiple appraoches to solve a
given problem.

Value: a piece of data(string, num, etc)
Variable: a container for a value

Naming format for variables:
    camel case: myVar, myName
    first letter MUST be in lowercase
    variable name CANNOT start with numbers: WRONG: 1var
    only _ and $ are allowed in variable name except for numbers and chars 
    avoid reserved keywords (eg. new, function, let, const)
    try to make your name meaningful: myVar a aa aaa


Data types:
    Number: floating point numbers
    String: squence of chars
    Boolean: true or false
    Undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty value)
    Null: Also means 'empty value'
    Symbol: values that is unique and cannot be changed
    BigInt: larger int than the number type

let, const, var
    let: creating a variable
    const: creating a const. If a variable is a const, the value of it cannot be 
    changed.
        const MUST have an initial value
    var: an old way to assign variable. (try to avoid using it)

Operators:
    math operators: +,-,*,/
    assgin operators: =, +=, -=, ++, --
    comparison operators (return a boolean): >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==
    opertor precedence: 5 + 4 * 3
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence
    equality operators: ==, ===
        ===: strict equality
        ==: loose equality. Do the type cast. Try to avoid using it.
