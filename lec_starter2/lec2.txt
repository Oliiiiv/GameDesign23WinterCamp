Function:
    Compose: function name, input/parameter, function body, output/return value
    function only works when it is called
    by using functions, we can reuse code blocks so as to write more maintainable code
    there are two ways to define a function:
        function declaration
            function declaration can be invoked/called before it's initialization/
            declaration
        function expression/anonymous function
            notice that in js, fucntion is also a kind of value, therefore it can be 
            stored in a variable. eg.calcAge in the lec2.js
            function expression CANNOT be called before it's declaration.
        arrow function: 
            input => output
            input => function body

Nested function: function calling other function

Objects:
a data structure that constains multiple variables, each with name assigned.
compare it with a cup: a cup can have a color, a design, a weight, a material, etc.
    create an object

Comparison between object and array
    array is usually used when we want to store some ordered and unstructured data
    object is usually be used when we want store structured data

Methods/Object Methods
    keyword: this
    retrieve data that is inside the object itself by using this keyword.
    In other words, this represents the object tha tis calling the Methods

array and string are also (built-in) objects!
string.length()

Constrcutor of an object
    -Instead of creating an object with information inside it, we are going
    to create an object blueprint (structure/placeholders)
    -In javascript, function is also a value! Therefore we can put functions
    inside an object
    -the function Person in line 128 is a constructor of a new object called
    person.
